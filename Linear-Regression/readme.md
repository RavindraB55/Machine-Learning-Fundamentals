# Linear Regression

Linear regression predicts the relationship between two variables by assuming a linear connection between the independent and dependent variables. It seeks the optimal line that minimizes the sum of squared differences between predicted and actual values.

To calculate best-fit line linear regression uses a traditional slope-intercept form which is given below,

Yi = β0 + β1Xi 

where Yi = Dependent variable,  β0 = constant/Intercept, β1 = Slope/Intercept, Xi = Independent variable.
