# Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is generally used for classification purposes. Unlike Linear Regression, the dependent variable can take a limited number of values only i.e, the dependent variable is categorical. When the number of possible outcomes is only two it is called Binary Logistic Regression.

The outputs of a linear regression are passed through an activation function (typically sigmoid), which maps the value to either 0 or 1.
